3 Day Jams Info

RULES
I will explore a concept that before was unknown to me and learn it from scratch.
I give myself at most 3 days worth of time to finish a game. Ideally the Jam lasts one weekend.
I allow myself a help of my girlfriend and online resources, so long as all lines of code are made by me from scratch.
I have to keep the deadline, completing in time is more important than additional features.
